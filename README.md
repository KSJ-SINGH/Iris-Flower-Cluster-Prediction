## Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
#### Author: Kunwardeep Singh Jagdev


---
## Project Goals:
- Predict the optimum of clusters from the dataset and represent it visually.
---
## Prerequisites:
In order to perform the intended test, I'll using `python3` as the main programming language and `Jupyter Notebook` as the computing platform.
I'll also require the below mentioned libraries to perform complete the task.
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Plotly
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Scikit-learn

If you do not have these libraries installed in your machine, Kindly run one of the below mentioned command.
> I recommend creating a `virtual environment` because it helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python `virtual environments` for them.

```bash
# if you use pip Packager
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
```bash
# If you are using conda Packager
conda install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib notebook scikit-learn
```
